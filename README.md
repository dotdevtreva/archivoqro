# So... What the heck are this?

*Archivo QRO.xlsm* Is the file that contains the built-in VBA proyect. You can open it and test all kind of features that i written.

The goal of this proyect was test the automation skills that iÂ´ve adquired, honestly, i never coded on VBA lenguage. This proyect was developed for EXCEL TECHNICAL SERVICES DE MEXICO, S.A. DE C.V. and is now is used on the operations.

Description, humm... I could say this is a user-proof GUI to manage a Microsoft Excel database. The database contains information about the existing documentation of all employees registred.

It's Custom software that complements a payroll system on the "Documentation Division" (This explain the import button who takes data from another .xls [*/aux-resources/Reporte de Trabajadores.xls*] )

Don't forget to see the Terms & Conditions on *Copyright.txt* and you'll see this is Open Source Software.
